            <h3>Alexis Mark is an office for research and graphic design in Copenhagen, Denmark. We are engaged with activities ranging from commissioned graphic design assignments, through self-organised autonomous projects, to design-education, exhibition-making and curating. Through cross-disciplinary collaborations we make publications, exhibitions, websites, identities, typefaces and more, primarily within the fields of art and culture. All driven by a particular interest in the concepts of language and mediation as an artistic practice and in an interdisciplinary context.
 Methodically, we seek a contextual engagement with the materials and conditions of the collaborations we are involved in and find it integral to our practice to extend these conditions into the work we produce. We embrace complexity as a value and seek to display and exploit diversity, rather than to reduce it by forcing simplicity. In this way we aim to create "idiosyncratic encyclopaedias" born from our research and criticality in exchange with all included parties.
 Through the same methodological approach, we work both independently as an autonomous entity and engage with external commissions. In that sense Alexis Mark is a service provider both to itself and others.

Alexis Mark is educated at Yale School of Art and The Gerrit Rietveld Academie.

Additionally, Alexis Mark is the founder and organizer of the exhibition– and project space Annual Reportt. </h3>
